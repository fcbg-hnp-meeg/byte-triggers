Arduino to Parallel Port converter
==================================

Parallel ports are less and less common on computers, and are not supported by macOS.
Instead, the `Fondation Campus Biotech Geneva <fcbg_>`_ developed a USB to parallel port
converter using an arduino.

The details can be found on this repository:
